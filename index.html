                <p>
                  I have always loved taking photos. I just started taking photos with my phone, and people loved them. I also loved the quality of the photos, but I wanted more. So I invested in a DSLR camera, and I never looked back since. Now i'm able to take full control of the photos that I take and have them come out looking exactly how i had in my mind for them to look.
